  caption: "Using the clickers allowed us to see students\u2019 responses and gauge\
    \ their understanding. We either described the distribution of responses to the\
    \ class or projected the histogram directly.\n\nDisagreements among students served\
    \ as excellent opportunities for discussions. We often asked students to discuss\
    \ their answers with their table-mates and try to convince each other. Students\
    \ could change their answers, and there was often a feedback loop."
